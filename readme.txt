My Simple Tube is a sidebar widget which will grab the latest youtube video tweets with your twitter's screen name in it and displays them as videos on your blog sidebar.

== Description ==

In order to show those youtube videos on the sidebar of your blog, all you need to do is to copy those share links under your own youtube channel and tweet them on twitter with your @twitter_screen_name and you will see those latest videos 
appear on your own blog sidebar, how many videos will show up will depend on how many videos you allow when you do the widget setting under "Enter the Numbers (1,2,3...) of Videos to Show" text box plus how many video urls you actually tweet
on twitter as well as the date you tweet them (the video which you have tweetted too long ago will not show up). When you tweet your own video with your twitter screen name, please
use the full youtube video sharing path which you can find under 'share' of that video on Youtube, for example, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9U3QIrPNs0 , if you tweet your video with shortern url 
then this program will not work. If your friends tweet their videos by mentioning your @twitter_screen_name, then their videos will appear on your blog
and if they have this widget on their own blog as well, then you can tweet your videos to them as well by mentioning their @twitter_screen_name. This widget also comes with a tweet button that allows
your friends and readers to further tweet those videos on your blog which will then further increase that video views on youtube. This is indeed a cool tool for
you to use to show videos on your blog without need to log into your wordpress blog to set the video link, you can change videos on your blog sidebar anytime you want by just tweeting
them on twitter.  

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Can I tweet other video link besides youtube? =

No, because this widget can only use to display youtube video.    

= Why is the video placement looks a little bit odd? = 

Well, youtube video normally is a lot more bigger than this but in order to fit the video into the sidebar, I will have to
make it smaller, so when a big video becomes small, it will look a little bit odd for sure.

= Can I replace the default screen name under the 'Enter Your Twitter Screen Name' input box? =

Yes, please do that, the default screen name is my twitter screen name, but if you have taken out that default twitter screen name
and leave the input box blank, then you will not see any video on your blog sidebar at all, so make sure you fill your own twitter screen name
into the box.

= How many videos can I display on my blog sidebar? =

As many as you want, but I think the best is only one. You can set the number of videos to show up under "Enter the Numbers (1,2,3...) of Videos to Show" textbox when you do the widget setting, please enter only number and no space in between, for example, 1 or 22 or 100 and so on.

= What are those things I need to know before twitting youtube video url? = 

1) Use the full url path which is located under 'share link' of your youtube video. All you need to do is to tweet your video link and mentioned your own twitter screen name, for example you can use the tweet text like this, @AB this is a great video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9U3QIrPNs0 , and this program will do the rest for you 2) Make sure you allow your youtube video to embed on your own blog or else you will see blank on your blog sidebar.
 
== Installation ==
